## Setup
NOTE: you need an account on studwiz.com

You need to create an `auth.json` file or run the cli one time through the command `python main.py` to create automatically a structured empty auth file.
Inside the file you need to make sure that there are the following values:
1. `"username": YOUR-USERNAME`
2. `"password": YOUR-PASSWORD`
Replace ´YOUR-USERNAME´ with the username (or email) to your account on studwiz.com and `YOUR-PASSWORD` with the corresponding password.
